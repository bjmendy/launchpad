# launchpad
Coding challenge for Launchpad Lab made in vanilla js.

Areas of update:
Forks
Commits
Pull requests

First, I set up the js file to make an active request to the Github API. I called the API to display to the page. Then, I made three headings and three AJAX calls to the respective API parts I wanted to display; pull requests, commits and forks.

I decided to use vanilla JS to challenge myself with every single component versus using a framework to build the application.

Looking at my code from old API applications, I realized I would have to do a complete overhaul with each section and different areas of pulling data. After cracking the first section, React, I used the logic displayed for the rest of the languages. Looking into the logic, the 479 count comes from the Github API call. While the forks are over 13k for some repos, the DOM would only allow 479 to be shown.

I enjoyed using vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM and make things work. It was refreshing to use and I enojoyed making this application.

In terms of styling, I'm normally a styling fanatic, but I kept it simple with the design. I brought in a gradient header with the images of the respective languages appended to the body.
