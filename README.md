# launchpad
Coding challenge for Launchpad Lab made in vanilla js.

Areas of update:
Forks
Commits
Pull requests

First, I set up the js file to make an active request to the Github API. I called the API to display to the page. Then, I made three headings and three AJAX calls to the respective API parts I wanted to display; pull requests, commits and forks.

I decided to use vanilla JS to challenge myself with every single component versus using a framework to build the application.
